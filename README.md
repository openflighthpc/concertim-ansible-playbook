# Building and configuring a Concertim MIA

This repository contains mechanisms to build and configure a Concertim MIA.

## Current attempt

See the [ansible README](ansible/README.md) for details on the current attempt
at installing a modernized version of MIA via an `ansible` playbook.

See the [vagrant](vagrant) directory for a Vagrant machine that uses the
ansible playbooks above.

## Previous attempts

See the tag `bootstrap-via-safe-persistent-reimplementation` for the now
aborted attempt to bootstrap by reimplementing parts of `safe-persistent
deploy`.
