# Developing the Concertim apps

This directory contains a [Vagrantfile](Vagrantfile) and associated scripts
that can be used to develop and test both the production ansible playbook and
to develop the metric reporting daemon and visualisation app components.

To develop and test the production ansible playbook see [these instructions](production/DEVELOPMENT.md).

To develop and test the concertim components themselves see [these instructions](contrib/dev/README.md).
