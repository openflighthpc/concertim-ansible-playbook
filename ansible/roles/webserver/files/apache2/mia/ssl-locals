# For now we use the SSL certificates that are generated by the openssl
# package.  They are untrusted.
#
# We should instead do one of the following:
#
# 1. Use Let's Encrypt certs and deal with certificate updating somehow.
# 2. Create our own self-signed certs and deal with them being untrusted.
# 3. Create our own certs but have them be trusted in some manner.
